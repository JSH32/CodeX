Data structures are specialized formats for efficiently organizing, storing, and managing data. They allow us to perform a variety of data operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting. Understanding and selecting the appropriate data structure for a given task can greatly improve the performance of your programs. This section will go over some of the most important data structures in C++.
