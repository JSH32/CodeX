# Intro to Classes and Methods

~~~admonish warning
Classes will not fully be described here but other sections in the [Data Structures](./index.md) chapter will be better understood. This will be fully explained in a future chapter.

### Introduction to Classes

In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that groups variables (known as attributes) and functions (called methods) under a single name. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class.

Think of a class like a template for a cookie-cutter: you can create many cookies (objects) with the same shape (attributes) and actions (methods).

### Attributes

Attributes are variables defined within a class. They represent the properties or actions of an object created from the class. For example, if we have a `Car` class, some possible attributes could be `color`, `brand`, and `speed`.

### Methods

Methods are functions defined within a class. They usually represent actions that can be performed by objects created from the class. Continuing with our `Car` example, some possible methods could be `accelerate()`, `brake()`, and `changeGear()`.
