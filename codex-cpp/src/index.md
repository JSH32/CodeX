# CodeX: C++
`C++, Introduction for Entry Level Programmers` is the first course in the CodeX series. 

```admonish
Not everything in this guide is designed to make sense at first, but it will always be covered later.
```

This is an introductory course designed to teach entry-level programmers the basics of the C++ programming language. The course will cover topics such as basic data types and operations, conditionals, loops, functions and classes, as well as advanced concepts like pointers, memory management, threads, and RAII. Throughout the course, you will learn how to write code in C++. People taking this course should (but are not required to) have a basic understanding of fundamentals, no prior experience with C++ is necessary.
