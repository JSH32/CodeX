# Unique Pointers

Smart pointers are a key feature of modern C++ that handle the allocation and deallocation of memory for you. `std::unique_ptr` is particularly useful because it manages a dynamically allocated object and automatically deletes the object when the `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope.

## Benefits of `std::unique_ptr`

- **Automatic Resource Management**: Automatically frees the associated memory without needing explicit `delete` calls.
- **Exclusive Ownership**: Ensures there's exactly one owner for the allocated memory, avoiding potential issues with multiple deletions.
- **Move Semantics**: Enables safe transfer of ownership from one `std::unique_ptr` to another.

## Creating and Using `std::unique_ptr`

Use `std::make_unique` to create a `std::unique_ptr` in a safe and convenient way.

### Example: Using `std::make_unique`

~~~admonish example title="Creating a `std::unique_ptr`"
```cpp,editable
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

int main() {
    auto uniquePtr = std::make_unique<int>(10); // Create a unique_ptr managing an int
    std::cout << "Value: " << *uniquePtr << std::endl; // Use the managed object
    // uniquePtr is automatically freed when going out of scope
    return 0;
}
```
~~~

`std::make_unique` is the preferred method to create a `std::unique_ptr` because it ensures memory safety, even in cases where exceptions might occur.

## Transferring Ownership with Move Semantics

Since `std::unique_ptr` cannot be copied, the ownership of the managed memory can be transferred using move semantics, by using the `std::move` function.

### Example: Moving a `std::unique_ptr`

~~~admonish example title="Transferring Ownership"
```cpp,editable
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

void processPointer(std::unique_ptr<int> ptr) {
    std::cout << "Processing value: " << *ptr << std::endl;
    // ptr will be automatically freed when the function scope ends
}

int main() {
    auto owner = std::make_unique<int>(20);
    processPointer(std::move(owner)); // Moves the ownership to processPointer

    if (owner) {
        std::cout << "Owner still has the unique_ptr." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Owner no longer has the unique_ptr." << std::endl;
    }

    // Safe to exit main, no manual delete needed
    return 0;
}
```

~~~admonish tip title="What Are Move Semantics?"
Move semantics in C++ allow you to efficiently transfer ownership of resources (like dynamically allocated memory) from one object to another. Instead of copying the data, moving an object transfers its internal data to a new object and leaves the original object in a valid but unspecified state (often empty or null). This process is especially important for managing resources in a safe and performance-optimized manner.

Remember, when using `std::unique_ptr`, no need to worry about `delete`, thanks to its automatic memory management. This smart pointer ensures that your dynamically allocated memory is released when itâ€™s no longer needed, which helps you to avoid memory leaks and keep your resource management clean and straightforward.
