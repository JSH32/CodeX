# Memory Management in C++

Memory management is an integral part of developing applications in C++. It's the practice of controlling how the memory in a computer program is allocated, used, and freed. Proper memory management is critical because it directly impacts program performance and stability.

Just as a strong foundation is necessary when constructing a house, a solid understanding of memory management is crucial for building reliable and efficient C++ programs.
