# Exception Handling

In programming, things don't always go as planned. Sometimes, errors occur, like trying to open a file that doesn't exist or dividing a number by zero. In C++, we have a way to deal with these unexpected events called exception handling.

Exception handling uses special code blocks to "catch" errors and deal with them so your program can keep running or shut down nicely instead of crashing. Imagine using a safety net to catch an acrobat if they fall; this is what exception handling does for your program!

In this section, we’ll cover the basics of how to work with these safety nets. We’ll learn how they help us find and handle the unexpected without making everything else complicated.
