# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (design) that uses "objects" to design and build applications. An object is a combination of data (attributes) and functions (methods) that can manipulate the data.

In this section, we will briefly introduce OOP concepts and provide simple examples to help you get started with OOP.
