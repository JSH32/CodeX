# Polymorphism

The term Polymorphism is derived from Greek words where 'Poly' means many and 'morphism' means forms. Hence, polymorphism represents the ability to take many forms.

In C++, polymorphism causes a member function to behave differently based on its calling object. This ability is achieved through method overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions.
