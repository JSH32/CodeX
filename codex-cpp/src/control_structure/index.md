# Control Structure
Control structures are fundamental building blocks in programming that help manage the flow of execution in a program. They allow you to create complex logic and decision-making capabilities by selectively executing code based on specific conditions or repetitions. The main elements of control structures include:

1. **Sequence**: This is the default control structure where code is executed line by line in the order it appears.

2. [**Flow Control**](./control_flow.md): These statements enable you to execute specific code blocks depending on whether certain conditions are true or false.

3. [**Jump Statements**](./jumps.md): Jump statements provide additional control over the flow of your program by transferring execution to another part of your code, skipping loop iterations, or ending loops prematurely.
