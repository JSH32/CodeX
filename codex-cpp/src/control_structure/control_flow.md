# Flow Control

Flow control in programs refers to the various methods used to manage the order and execution of code based on certain conditions or repetitions. Key elements of flow control include:

1. [**Conditional Statements**](./conditional.md): These include `if`, `if-else`, and `switch` statements, which allow you to execute specific code blocks based on conditions being true or false.

2. [**Loops**](./loops.md): These include `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, which enable you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specific condition or a predetermined number of iterations.
