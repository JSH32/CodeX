Welcome to the CodeX Foundation, a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) initiative dedicated to creating educational materials on a variety of computational topics. Our mission is to provide high-quality resources for learners, enthusiasts, and professionals interested in programming, computer science, data science, artificial intelligence, and other topics.

## Our Mission
We believe that everyone should have access to educational resources that enable them to learn cutting-edge technologies and keep up with the most recent advancements in computing fields. Our goal is to:

1. Develop comprehensive computational textbooks and learning materials.
2. Maintain an active contributor community that works together to write, edit, review, and design these resources.
3. Make our work available under open licenses, allowing anyone to use, share, adapt, and build on it.

## Why FOSS?
As a FOSS initiative, we are committed to providing free access to our content and fostering collaboration among contributors from around the world.
